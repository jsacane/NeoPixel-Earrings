# NeoPixel Earrings
Animated RGB LED earrings that change animation every 20 seconds. This build was programmed on an Arduino Gemma using the Adafruit NeoPixel library, and only requires a Gemma board, 16 LED NeoPixel Ring, and LiPo battery. A new build is being developed with a Sparkfun Electret Microphone BOB to change animations when the user claps, as opposed to using a timer.
